good morning miss and 
my friends, my Name is ivanco
so today i would like
to presents about is renting a
house is better than buying one 
i devided my presentation into 3 part
and i open Q&A session at the end of
my presentation. I choose this topic because
i want to share about why buying a house is
more profitable than renting a house.

do you prefer renting a house or buy one?
some of us will prefer renting a house
and the others will prefer buy a house.
ya this is still an endless debate
Renting a house is an option 
for most people who have 
a modest income, 
so they have no choice and 
rent a house for a place to 
rest and gather with their 
family. although if you think 
about it there are still many 
out there who sell houses at 
prices that are still 
affordable and can be by way 
of credit, but back to the 
thoughts of each individual.

in my opinion, buying a house
is better than renting a house
why?
first reason is addingonal cost
for moving if the lease expires
for example:
if we rent a house and  take 
a short period for example 
1 year. well 1 year is very 
short and makes us have to 
rent a house again, if we 
don't have a car to carry 
things. it causes us to rent 
a car and of course increase 
our expenses.
second reasons is buying 
a house is investing.
many people say buying 
a house is the same as
investing. Why?
because buying a house 
either by way of credit 
or by any means. when 
we have another house and 
want to sell our house, 
we can be sure that the 
selling price of the 
house can be higher 
than the initial purchase 
price because the house 
price will be higher every 
year. whether it is sold as 
land or counted as a house.

next reason is the future is 
more secure if you buy a house
By buying a house we don't 
have to worry about looking 
for another house because the 
house is ours and we don't 
have to worry about the 
rental price of the house 
going up because we just need 
to pay the electricity bill, 
water which is more or less 
the same as when we rented a 
house.

last reason is buying a house
means buying property too.
what does that means?
by buying a house we will definitely
buy the furniture such as 
furniture, etc.
then what is the connection?
if we buy property that 
is classy and has the potential
for high selling prices for 
the next few years. we can 
buy it and we can sell it when
the selling price is higher 
than the purchase price. 
for example paintings, 
table decorations such as 
flower vases that have nice 
shapes and motifs, etc.

thoose are the reasons why 
buying a house is better than 
renting a house.

that's all about my 
presentation, i'm sorry if i
had a mistake in conveying
this topics. thank you for
your attention.
